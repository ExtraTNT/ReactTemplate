## Why?
Because i think it's stupid to build a website from ground every time you want to build one... this repo is a base with some utilities and components to build a website in a short amount of time.
## contribute to this repo
feel free to contribute to this repo, i'm open to any kind of contribution (issues, pull requests, ideas, ...) if you want, fork this repo and make your own version. the beauty of open source is that it helps the community, and if you have fun to do something, do it...
## License
this project is licensed under the [gpl v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)  
i need to check if gpl v3 is good for this project or if a other license is better in this case... if you want to build a website based on this project, just do it, if there is a problem with gpl in this case, i don't care... but if you fork this project or work on / with it in a other way, pls respect the license...
## Handy stuff
 - install a new nodejs version, because the default one in your (apt) repo does maybe not work
 - npm clean-install is handy, if you fuck up
 - echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p helps if you have "No space left on device"
