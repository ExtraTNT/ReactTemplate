# ReactTemplate
just a react template with some stuff... use at your own risk  
i hope it helps you to get started with react / webdevelopment / programming / whatever  
it's not perfect, it's work in progress, but why not have it public aviable for everyone?  
have fun, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Q & A in this repo)

## Handy stuff
 - install a new nodejs version, because the default one on in your (apt) repo does maybe not work
 - npm clean-install is handy, if you fuck up
 - echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p helps if you have "No space left on device"
